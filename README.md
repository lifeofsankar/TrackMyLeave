| **Frontend** | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript |
| **Backend** | PHP |
| **Database** | MySQL |
| **Server** | Apache (via XAMPP/WAMP) |


## üîí A Note on Security
This project was built for educational purposes to demonstrate DBMS concepts. For this reason, passwords are currently stored in plain text.

**For a production environment, it is crucial to hash passwords** using a strong algorithm like `bcrypt` via PHP's `password_hash()` and `password_verify()` functions to ensure user data is secure.

### Prerequisites
- A web server with PHP support (e.g., Apache via XAMPP, WAMP, or LAMP).
- MySQL server to host the database.

### 1. Set up the Database
- Locate the `db.sql` file in the project folder.
- Using a tool like phpMyAdmin, import `db.sql` to create the `dbms_project` database, required tables, and sample user data.

### 2. Configure Database Connection
- Open the `config.php` file.
- Update the `$servername`, `$username`, `$password`, and `$dbname` variables to match your local MySQL configuration.

### 3. Place Files in Web Server Directory
- Copy the entire project folder to your web server's document root (e.g., `htdocs/` for XAMPP).

### 4. Access the Project
- Start your Apache and MySQL services.
- Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME/main_login.html`.

### 5. Test Credentials
- **Admin:** `admin1` / `pass123`
- **Student:** `student1` / `pass123`
- **Faculty:** `faculty1` / `pass123`
